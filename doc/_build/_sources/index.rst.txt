Welcome to LocVib's documentation!
==================================

The LocVib tools provide a number of features for analyzing calculated vibrational spectra in terms
of localized modes. For details on the theoretical background, see

Ch. Jacob, M. Reiher, J. Chem. Phys. 130 (2009), 084106 (https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3077690).
